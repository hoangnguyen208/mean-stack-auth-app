# mean-stack-auth-app

This is the MEAN stack authentication app which allow users can register their usernames. After that, users can still log in their account then explore their dashboards as well as their profiles. 

The users' accounts are saved forever in my mongoDB database and their passwords are fully confidential by bcrypt protection. This means that even I as a database controller may know users' information such as username, email, name after their registration, but their passwords are still fully crypted even in my database.

This is the link to this app:
